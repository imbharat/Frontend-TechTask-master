##### Remaining Task

1) 	Make UI responsive for different screen sizes/multiple devices
	Although the relative units for all CSS properties (wherever applicable) were used (such as rem or %). But media queries need to be applied.
	
	Note: the existing properties which had px units were not modified (which means the task would be to change all fixed units to relative ones and then apply media queries).
	
2)	Write more unit tests, covering more cases, and increasing code coverage to reduce the errors.

3)	For dynamically passing parameters to graphql queries use some npm package (like apollo-client) instead of replacing the the parameters in the
	string.
